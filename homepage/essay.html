            <h1>Citi-Bikes</h1>
          <p>
            The first time I rode a citi bike, I almost died. It was not my first time riding a bike, but a first time for me riding in the city. It’s very different when you are riding a bike around in a park than riding one in the bike lane of a traffic filled Canal street. My sister and I had to go to Duane Reade for a vaccination appointment in early 2020, and she recommended us to citi bike there since it would save us time. I was very nervous, as I always tend to do with new things, but I reluctantly agreed. We got our citi bikes and started down the road, with my sister in the front and me trailing. I would not say the ride was bad, but definitely very eventful. What I mean by this is that I didn’t realize how crazy my sister was biking in the city. So when she ran a redlight, I didn’t notice the traffic lights color wasn’t green and I also did not notice the speeding taxi on my left. By some miracle, I had managed to barely dodge the speeding car but not the mouthful the driver had to say to me. After that experience my immediate thought wasn’t just fear, but excitement. I had never gotten into an incident like that before and a wave of adrenaline filled my brain. Bike rides in the city changed after that moment from butterflies in my stomach to feelings of euphoria clouding my mind. That eventful evening changed my perspective on the city. I could now see adventures at every corner. Once we had finished our ride, it was time to park the bikes. The simple rack that I had departed from hours earlier had now taken a new meaning and opened up a new world for me.
            The rack never really stood out to me in the past. I had walked by it on the way to the grocery store but never really took the time to examine it. I could see it outside of my parent’s bedroom window everyday and slowly found myself unconsciously observing small details about it. Someone that saw the station for the first time would say that there is nothing special to this station, but they are very wrong. They do not notice the gang of elderly women sitting on the bench next to the rack, gossiping about the danger of young kids riding their bikes on the sidewalks, or the slight rust on the station, or that there are 40 spots available but only 30 fill up. I think the most overlooked traits that they would miss are the potential adventures each citi bike dock contains. Most citi bike rides are uneventful. There are the regulars that live in the neighborhood that I see biking to their office jobs as an everyday commuter while I walk to school. However, there are always people out of the ordinary that bring new and old experiences to my dock. If I am lucky, then I can try and guess where the bike has been. Did the bike Cross  a bridge? Why is the seat so low? Why is it so high? People decorate the bikes with their own tags as a way of owning it, giving it a sense of uniqueness that leaves the door open for my curiosity to escape and wonder. I make stories of the places the bikes have been, who has sat on them, and what purpose their use was. The citi bike rack became my own personal imagination story board, allowing me to view the city through a new lens. Citi bike racks are ubiquitous, allowing not only me to live potential adventures, but everyone in New York City and even the city itself to absorb those experiences.
            New York City has a lot of diversity, in its people and neighborhoods, and because of citi bikes we are able to explore and experience it. As a result, Citi bikes docks are everywhere throughout the city, and if one station on Clinton street can unlock endless story ideas, imagine what a whole city filled with them can do. Citi bike stations capture the experiences of their riders and also the unique neighborhoods that are scattered throughout, making New York City my own through the stories that they tell, and the ones that they receive.
